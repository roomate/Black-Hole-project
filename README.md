# Compact Objects and Black Holes

‚≠ê‚û°Ô∏èüï≥Ô∏è
Ever wondered how an object collapse into a black hole ? This project will help you understand in the academic case of a 
self-collapsing homogeneous and rotationally symmetric star. In particular, with the tools of General Relativity, we can plot 
the trajectory of the rays of light when irresistibly falling into it.
This project is based on the very first paper dealing with the subject 
[On Continued Gravitational Contraction](http://www.weylmann.com/oppenheimer2.pdf), written by Oppenheimer itself!
