## Black Holes

‚≠ê‚û°Ô∏èüï≥Ô∏è
Ever wondered how an object collapse into a black hole ? This project will help you understand in the academic case of a 
self-collapsing homogeneous and rotationally symmetric star. In particular, with the tools of General Relativity, we can plot 
the trajectory of the rays of light when irresistibly falling into it.
This project is based on the very first paper dealing with the subject 
[On Continued Gravitational Contraction](http://www.weylmann.com/oppenheimer2.pdf), written by Oppenheimer itself!

It was done in collaboration with Thomas Levasseur.

## Cosmology

In complement, you can find a notebook on Cosmology. Friedmann equation (or more bluntly the spherical collapse equation)
is solved for different cosmologies. It is standard and remains basic level in cosmology theory, but yet is fundamental to understand 
the long-time behaviour of large-scale structures.
